Arc

This is used to draw a Petri Net Arc.  After selecting
the Arc option, click the mouse button on the Place or
Transition where the Arc will begin.  Click the mouse
button again at either an ending component, or an
intermediate point between the source and destination
for the Arc. There may be any number of intermediate
points. If you start at a Place, you must end at a
Transition, and vise versa.  Since Petri Net Arcs have
a direction associated with them, they will end up
pointing at whatever Petri Net Component that you end
the drawing at, which will be denoted by a small
arrowhead pointing into the component.

Also, when drawing Arcs, the number of Tokens it will
take to enable that Arc can be specified in the lower
part of the Petri Net Tool window, just above the
Status Panel.

When trying to select an Arc for Cut, Copy, and Delete
functions, simply have the Pointer button selected, then
click the mouse anywhere along the length of the Arc.
When selected, small green squares, one at each junction,
will denote its selection.
