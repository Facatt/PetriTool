Help

You can get help at almost every button and menuitem
in PetriTool.

To get help about something is very simple:

1) Choose 'Select Item' in the menu bar, or press the help button
   on the Control Panel (far right button with a "?" on it)
2) Choose a menu or button to get help about that object.
