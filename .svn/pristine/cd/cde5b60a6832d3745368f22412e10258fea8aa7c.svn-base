Token

Use this button to place Tokens in the Petri Net.  The
design will only allow you to position a Token in a grid
space occupied by a place.  In the Component Panel, just
above the Status Panel at the bottom of the Petri Net Tool
window, you can select the number of Tokens you wish to
draw.  This number will also appear in the design after
you have selected a position for the Tokens.
